# Password Manager

This is a mini project designed to securely manage user passwords. The project allows users to store and retrieve passwords for their accounts in a safe and encrypted manner. The main focus of this project is security, ensuring that only the user can access their saved passwords.

## How it works:

The user enters their master password, which is preset to 'gabriel'. If the master password is correct, the user can add and view their accounts stored in the 'password.txt' file. When adding an account, the password is encrypted before being saved to the file. When the user selects to view their accounts, the program decrypts the passwords and displays the account details.

The current Master Password to access the user is set to 'gabriel'.
